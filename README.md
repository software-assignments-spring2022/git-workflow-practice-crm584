Interesting website related to software development: [SOUL First Public Beta Release](https://juce.com/discover/stories/soul-first-public-beta-release)

This article is a few years old, but it's something I've been meaning to check back in on since I found it. SOUL is an audio programming language and API that reduces overhead for audio processing. This makes it immediately more efficient for any audio application, reducing power and memory usage across the board. SOUL was created by JUCE, which is a 
>  partially open-source cross-platform C++ application framework, used for the development of desktop and mobile applications.

[Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiNoqH26ef1AhVPjIkEHYZECg8QmhN6BAgdEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJUCE&usg=AOvVaw1qppdcuIPOoBnKup2sTrp5)

SOUL is still in the early part of its life cycle, but I think that the lower overhead will make it a valuable tool to work with when coding audio in the future, for any application.


### comment from Brad Feng

I think this is interesting since, as someone who knows nothing about programming audio, making it more accessible is cool. I tried the demo online and it was pretty neat.
